# GitHandler
The project is a set of classes designed to provide high level interfaces for some Git entities using libgit2.
Currently implemented: fetching and cloning (no authentification support as for now) and basic functionality for classes representing repositories, branches and commits.
Also it is possible to collect changes that have occured since the last fetch so a user can retrieve them if necessary.
